Renner, Karen J. "The Appeal of the Apocalypse." *Lit: Literature Interpretation Theory* 23 (2012): 203-11.

203:  "apocalyptic motifs to highlight the shortcomings of our present society and envision an improved community."

203:  "One can, in fact, come up with a recognizable film title from every year of our century that delves into apocalyptic matters in one way or another." Unfortunately, I thought the point would be that the title of the movie contained the year in question, but that was not the case.

204:  apocalyptic="disaster threatened but not realized"; post-apocalyptic="the catastrophe having already taken place" Note conflation of apocalyptic, disaster and catastrophe. These can't be the same things.

204:  Quoting from Daniel Wojcok *The End of the World as We Know It: Faith, Fatalism, and Apocalypse in America* New York UP (1997): "Until recently, the end of the world has been interpreted as a meaningful, transformative, and supernatural event, involving the annihilation and renewal of the earth by deities or divine forces. During the last half of the twentieth century, however, widespread beliefs about a meaningless apocalypse have emerged and now compete with traditional religious apocalyptic worldviews." (page 1)

204:  Quoting from Elizabeth Rosen *Apocalyptic Transformation: Apocalypse and the Postmodern Imagination* Lexington Books (2008), neo-apocalyptic is "a literature of pessimism...positing potential means of extinction and predicting the glooming probabilities of such ends" (page xv).

205:  Quoting from Kim Newman *Apocalypse Movies: End of the World Cinema* St. Martin's Griffin (2000), appeal of apocalypse is "a half-wished for descent into dog-eat-dog barbarity and the extermination of all the boring people in the world" (page 19).

205:  increased focus on the "physical aspects of survival" more common in recent apocalyptic narratives; survivalism. Suggests there is a connection here to the increase in people who take up running, especially obstacle (including zombie) courses/races.

206:  "if a defining characteristic of the neo-apocalyptic narrative is a sense of pessimism, then most popular apocalyptic narratives do not fit this pattern at all, for they do far more than simply affirm our suspicions that our current world is corrupt and encourage us to delight in its destruction." Cites *The Walking Dead*, especially the television show as an example of this.

207:  Gives the example of Rick killing the bicycle woman, 'I'm sorry this happened to you' as an example of his democratic respect for all life and his moral superiority vis a vis empathy/sympathy. This distinguishes him from others who prioritize themselves over the wellbeing of others.

208:  "Even when these self-sacrificing characters do meet their demise, their deaths are typically depicted as tragic but necessary sacrifices that ultimately end up saving the world somehow or at least aiding the remaining survivors."

208:  "the apocalypse narrative thus reveals itself to be deeply moralistic, imagining a new world order."
