Degoul, Franck. "'We are the mirror of your fears': Haitian Identity and Zombification.' In *Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human*, edited by Deborah Christie and Sarah Juliet Lauro, 24--38. New York: Fordham UP, 2011.

24:  during American occupation of Haiti in first part of twentieth century, the Haitian zombie and zombification enters into anthropology and popular culture becoming the dominant way in which Haiti and Haitians are perceived in US and Europe as combination of zombification and witchcraft.

25:  witchcraft + zombification becomes the image of Haiti and the Caribbean. 

25:  Haitian revolution culminated in having to pay back France for their loss of slaves and the death of French soldiers. This forced Haiti to take a series of loans, which culminated in perpetual debt.

26:  The resultant debt, depressed economy, and political unrest led the US to invade in 1915, remaining there until 1934. "The national bank, commerce, industry, the administration, the army: all these sectors would be placed under American control."

26:  The occupation of Haiti coincided with a generally interventionist foreign policy in the Caribbean and Central America, including Cub, Panama, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico.

26-7:  It is in this context that the myth of the zombie grew the book *The Magic Island*, a "quasi-anthropological" book by William Seabrook, which drew upon superstitions about African religion, projected them onto the blacks of Haiti--"black, despotic, cannibalistic"--and this image was, in turn, used to justify the occupation of Haiti as a civilizing mission.

27:  Shortly after publication of *The Magic Island*, the first zombie movie, "White Zombie," was produced in 1932. This movie had "the master of zombies" transformed a "young American into a living-dead girl." 

27:  The next major zombie film was "I Walked with a Zombie" in 1943. Attempted to be more historical, putting the zombie in the context of slavery, the movie nonetheless continues to "identify NÃ©gritude with 'Vaudou,' and Vaudou with 'what is half-incomprehensible, half frightening.'"

28:  Thus, white=civilized, American, superior and black=barbaric, superstitious, inferior is established. This, in turn, allows the civilized to blame the barbaric for being barbaric without looking to their own culpability in the condition of dominated; e.g., the context of the Haitian Revolution and the French imposition of debt. By clinging to voodoo (whether real or imagined), it was supposed that the Haitians were refusing to accept the civilizing gesture from America. 

29:  Hence, a series of equations that resist civilization: "Haiti: it is Vaudou; Vaudou: witchcraft; and witchcraft... zombification."

29:  "Haiti had been occupied, but it defended itself by means of zombification, a practice that scared the 'blancs'--that is to say, in the Haitian sense of the term, the 'outsiders.'" It is said that the first American general to step on Haitian soil was zombified.

29-30:  "Americans fear zombification, express it in all sorts of mediums, and are right to perceive the object of their fear in this way: zombification is precisely that which escapes them, and which simultaneously constitutes Haiti's mysterious power amid the neocolonial effort by which the North American hegemony had attempted to establish itself."

30:  There is tension, along these lines, between Haiti and the Dominican Republic and Haiti and the United States, both seen as actual or potential invading forces.

31:  "Thus it is inadvisable to neglect this major dimension of the problem, concerning Haiti's position among surrounding fields of power--be they political, economic, or geopolitical. Set between the Dominican Republic (rich, touristy, and supported by the United States) and Cuba (with its Castro supporters, and so near the American superpower), Haiti (one of the poorest countries in the world, and the poorest in the Caribbean) finds itself at the very center of a sort of triangulation that explains a number of facts of recent postcolonial history."

32:  Haitians project back the zombification against invaders as a weapon: they will transform invaders into zombies, they will use magical powders.

36-7:  "it doesn't escape anyone that the 'whites,' the foreigners, and especially the Americans, have been interested in the popular Haitian religion and its magical-religious aspects and elements of sorcery for a very long time; they come to this--to understand, to know, to dominate--by means of a strategic 'intelligence' or by bribery. Whatever its exact nature, their marked interest in this field of expression, which has become symbolic of the sociocultural Haitian, masks an undeniable desire to seize hold of what which the Haitian national identity is founded on, and which gives it its strength and power."

37:  "Vaudou, and zombification as a result, is strictly of a Haitian nature, but it is also 'Negro.'"
