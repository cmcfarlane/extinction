Canavan, Gerry. "Hope, But Not for Us: Ecological Science Fiction and the End of the World in Margaret Atwood's *Oryx and Crake* and *The Year of the Flood*." *Lit: Literature Interpretation Theory* 23 (2012): 13--59.
===

138:  Begins with Fredric Jameson's observation that "It seems to be easier for us today to imagine the thorough-going deterioration of the earth and of nature than the breakdown of late capitalism" (*Seeds of Time*, xii). For Jameson, this inability to imagine anything other than a naturalized capitalism marks the shift from modernity to post-modernity.

139:  Apocalypse "is the only thing in our time that seems to have the capacity to shake the foundations of the system and 'jumpstart' a history that now seems completely moribound"

139:  "Apocalypse (especially eco-apocalypse) is increasingly the frame we use for imagining an end to capitalism, precisely because (after the 'end of history') we can't imagine any other possible way for it to end."

139:  "the increasingly dire predictions of ecological science warn us that 'the end of the world' and 'the end of capitalism' may in fact describe the same event--the one is catapulting us faster and faster towards the other."

139:  "the unexpected utopian potency lurking within our contemporary visions of eco-apocalypse"

140:  "Snowman's broken watch now functions as an index of the radical dissolution of the capitalist system. The watch's blank face shows Snowman 'zero hour,' an encounter with the void that 'causes a jolt of terror to run through him, this absence of official time. Nobody nowhere knows what time it is."

141: Commenting on Snowman's memory of self-help/management books: "the tight relationship between fantasies of apocalypse and fantasies of frontier--the notion that after the end of civilization the entire world becomes again free and open land, to be once again molded and 'tamed' by heroic individuals."

141:  In *Oryx & Crake*, the pre-apocalyptic (dystopian) is much worse than the post-apocalyptic (potentially utopian). 

142:  "the entire plot of the book unfurls through the recovery of Jimmy's buried traumatic memories of the unhappy hypercapitalist system of which he is now the last survivor."

143:  "There are then, crucially, *two* dystopias in *Oryx and Crake*: the post-apocalyptic, representing the fear that things might change, and the pre-apocalyptic, representing the fear that they might not."

144:  "civilization is in truth a terror, history itself a monster. One cannot help but wonder, after playing Blood & Roses, if the human history that has been wiped out by the apocalypse is actually worthy of being mourned at all."

151:  "If the problem is culture, we might have had a chance; but if the problem is our *nature*--if we're just built wrong--then there is no hope."

151:  "A person who truly believed *Oryx and Crake* is a possible vision of the future would indeed have no hope for mankind."

153:  "The effect of these endings is perhaps the greatest disproof of Crake's scientistic emphasis on mechanism and determinability present in both novels; both novels culminate in a moment of radical choice for the characters, a moment that cannot be reduced to clean, empirical measurement, and which can only be tackled by dirty and messy humanistic thinking."

155:  "I read *Oryx and Crake* and *The Year of the Flood* as asserting through allegory the urgent necessity of radically changing our social relations and anti-ecological lifestyles--of choosing to make a better *social* world before it is too late for the natural one."

155:  Quoting Lawrence Buell *The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing and the Formation of American Culture* Princeton UP, 1995 (285): "Apocalypse is the single most powerful master metaphor that the contemporary environmental imagination has at its disposal"
