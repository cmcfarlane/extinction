8:  "Hard to believe that reconstruction had progressed so far that clock-watching had returned, the slacker's code, the concept weekend."

34:  "2.4 stragglers per floor in this type of structure and .05 there. Numbers permitted Buffalo to extrapolate the whole city from Zone One, speculate about how long it will take *X* amount of three-men sweeper units to clear the island zone by zone, north to south and river to river. Then on to other cities. There was no other entity like New York City, but the silent downtowns bided across the country with their micropopulations, acolytes of the principles of the grid. The truths of the grid's rectilinear logic, its consequences, of how people moved and lived inside boundaries, had already been applied to cities across the country through the decades, anywhere human activity and desire needed to be tamed and made compliant. Gangs of high-rises in Southwest municipalities flush with internet money, sterile pedestrian malls in Midwest cities of a certain size, run-down waterfront districts of fabricated historical import that had been tarted up into tourist mills. Sure, there was the problem of scale, but Manhattan was the biggest version of everywhere."

40:  "Religion had been a taboo subject in former times, but now impromptu proselytizing sessions broke out in besieged department-store stockrooms, in the attics of crumbling Midwest Victorians, as the holed-up survivors swapped deities and afterlife hypotheses. It passed the time until morning and the resumption of the gauntlet."

42:  "Provisional governments were really big these days, an international fad in the grand old style."

53:  "'Survivors are slow or incapable of forming new attachments,' or so the latest diagnoses droned, although a cynic might identify this as a feature of modern life merely intensified or finetuned with the introduction of the plague."

54: "Everyone suffered from PASD. ... In the new reckoning, a hundred percent of the world was mad. Seemed about right."

54-5:  "According to the specialists, symptoms included feelings of sadness or unhappiness; irritability or frustration, even over small matters; loss interest or pleasure in normal activities; reduced sex drive; insomnia or excessive sleeping; changes in appetite leading to weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain; reliving traumatic events through hallucinations or flashbacks; agitation or restlessness; being 'jumpy' or easily startled; slowed thinking, speaking, or body movements; indecisiveness, distractibility, and decreased concentration; fatigue, tiredness, and loss of energy so that even small tasks seem to require a lot of effort; feelings of worthlessness or guilty; trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions, and remembering things; frequent thoughts of death, dying, or suicide; crying sells for not apparent reason, as opposed to those triggered by the memories of the fallen world; unexplained physical problems, such as back pain, increased blood pressure and heart rate, nausea, diarrhea, and headaches. Nightmares, goes without saying."

55:  "'What happened,' Mark Spitz asked, 'he get bit?' 'No, it's his past,' he heard the comm operator say. The recruit moaned some more. 'His past?' "His P-A-S-D, man, his P-A-S-D. Give me a hand."

77:  "They knew they were being fundamentally altered, in their very cells, inducted into a different class of trauma than the rest of the survivors. Semper fi. Then they went inside."

79:  "Early in the reboot, Buffalo agreed on the wisdom of rebranding survival."

81:  "A neutralized skel was a perfect stage for one's sadism, whether you were a dabbler, merely taking your time in terminating the thing before you, pruning a finger here or an ear there, or a master-level practitioner, restless all night trying to think up novel variations."

82:  "Although the subject was no mentioned in the PASD seminars Herkimer held with the camp shrinks, it was generally assumed that this behavior was a healthy outlet. Occupational therapy."

85:  "In his mind, the business of existence was about minimizing consequences."

112:  "Did they speak, that was the first test. Did they still have language. You took it from there. Before the rise of the camps, out in the land, you had to watch out for other people. The dead were predictable. People were not."

115:  "He stopped hooking up with other people once he realized the first he did was calculate whether or not he could outrun them."

130:  "The plague had a knack for narrative closure."

131:  "Today a rusty machete and bag of almonds made you a person of substance."

139:  "It was not hard to see the inhabitants of the camps devolve into demented relics too damaged to do anything more than dwindle into extinction in a generation or two."

179:  "He told himself: Hope is a gateway drug, don't do it."

180-1:  "As before, home was a beloved barricade. When school, work, the many-headed beast of strangers and villains comprising the world threatened to destroy, home remained, family remained, and the locks would hold, the lullabies would ward off all bogeymen. He was trapped in this house and he couldn't think of where else he'd rather be."

193:  "the refuge had done what all refuges do eventually: It failed."

196:  "It was not so glamorous to spend two days doubled over, shitting your guts out because you'd gambled on the expired bottle of kiwi juice."

197:  "The townspeople, of course, were the real monsters. It was the business of the plague to reveal our family members, friends, and neighbors as the creatures they had always been."

214:  "If the beings they destroyed were their own creations, and not the degraded remnants of the people described on the things' driver's licenses, so be it. We never see other people anyway, only the monsters we make of them."

215:  "They were human beings, after all, and full of things that needed to be put down."

221:  "When the wall fell, it fell quickly, as if it had been waiting for this moment, as it it had been created for the very instant of its failure. Barricades collapsed with haste once exposed for the riddled and rotten things they had always been. Beneath that facade of stability they were as ethereal as the society that created them. All the feverish subroutines of his survival programs booted up, for the first time in so long, and he located the flaw the instant before it expressed itself: there."

231:  "If they could bring back paperwork, Mark Spitz thought, they could certainly reanimate prejudice, parking tickets, and reruns."
