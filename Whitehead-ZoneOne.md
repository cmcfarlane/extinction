8:  "Hard to believe that reconstruction had progressed so far that clock-watching had returned, the slacker's code, the concept weekend."

30:  PASD--Post-Apocalyptic Survivor Dysfunction

34:  urban geography

40:  prayer/religion

42:  "Provisional governments were really big these days, an international fad in the grand old style."

53:  "'Survivors are slow or incapable of forming new attachments,' or so the latest diagnoses droned, although a cynic might identify this as a feature of modern life merely intensified or finetuned with the introduction of the plague."

54: "Everyone suffered from PASD. ... In the new reckoning, a hundred percent of the world was mad. Seemed about right."

54-5:  "According to the specialists, symptoms included feelings of sadness or unhappiness; irritability or frustration, even over small matters; loss interest or pleasure in normal activities; reduced sex drive; insomnia or excessive sleeping; changes in appetite leading to weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain; reliving traumatic events through hallucinations or flashbacks; agitation or restlessness; being 'jumpy' or easily startled; slowed thinking, speaking, or body movements; indecisiveness, distractibility, and decreased concentration; fatigue, tiredness, and loss of energy so that even small tasks seem to require a lot of effort; feelings of worthlessness or guilty; trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions, and remembering things; frequent thoughts of death, dying, or suicide; crying sells for not apparent reason, as opposed to those triggered by the memories of the fallen world; unexplained physical problems, such as back pain, increased blood pressure and heart rate, nausea, diarrhea, and headaches. Nightmares, goes without saying."

55:  "'What happened,' Mark Spitz asked, 'he get bit?' 'No, it's his past,' he heard the comm operator say. The recruit moaned some more. 'His past?' "His P-A-S-D, man, his P-A-S-D. Give me a hand."

77:  "They knew they were being fundamentally altered, in their very cells, inducted into a different class of trauma than the rest of the survivors. Semper fi. Then they went inside."

79:  "Early in the reboot, Buffalo agreed on the wisdom of rebranding survival."

81:  "A neutralized skel was a perfect stage for one's sadism, whether you were a dabbler, merely taking your time in terminating the thing before you, pruning a finger here or an ear there, or a master-level practitioner, restless all night trying to think up novel variations."

82:  "Although the subject was no mentioned in the PASD seminars Herkimer held with the camp shrinks, it was generally assumed that this behavior was a healthy outlet. Occupational therapy."

85:  "In his mind, the business of existence was about minimizing consequences."

112:  "Did they speak, that was the first test. Did they still have language. You took it from there. Before the rise of the camps, out in the land, you had to watch out for other people. The dead were predictable. People were not."

115:  "He stopped hooking up with other people once he realized the first he did was calculate whether or not he could outrun them."

130:  "The plague had a knack for narrative closure."

131:  "Today a rusty machete and bag of almonds made you a person of substance."

139:  "It was not hard to see the inhabitants of the camps devolve into demented relics too damaged to do anything more than dwindle into extinction in a generation or two."
