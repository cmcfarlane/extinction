Kee, Chera. "'They are not men... they are dead bodies': From Cannibal to Zombie and Back Again." In *Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human*, edited by Deborah Christie and Sarah Juliet Lauro, 9--23. New York: Fordham UP, 2011.

9:  "The earliest zombies were neither sick nor cannibalistic; they were victims of an exotic religion, used as slaves, forced to submit to the will of a zombie master."

9:  "The zombie is one of the few popular Hollywood monsters that come from outside Europe; rather, it arises out of stories connected to Haitian voodoo, and early zombie fiction in the United States owes much to fears of Haiti as an independent black republic."

10:  "the zombie has never quite managed to shake its Haitian heritage."

11:  "As the hemisphere's only black-ruled republic, Haiti naturally spawned much curiosity, which was fueled by the fact that the island existed in virtual isolation: trade embargoes and the lack of international diplomatic recognition effectively sealed Haiti off from the rest of the world."

11:  "the revolution and the nation it produced could never been seen as successful."

12:  Spencer St. John, who never attended a voodoo meeting, wrote a book in 1884 called *Hayti, or the Black Republic*, and connected voodoo to "cannibalism, human sacrifice, and grave robbing in what would become one the most-read texts on Haiti in the nineteenth century." St. John believed that cannibalism was absent under French rule because slave-owners would notice that slaves were missing; hence, according to St. John, cannibalism was a consequence of the revolution. 

13:  "Zombie" was unknown outside Haiti until 1929, being introduced into American culture with William Seabrook's *The Magic Island*. Seabrook's description of the zombie: "The zombie, they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life--it is a dead body which is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive."

14:  Zombies were used as slaves by those who created them. More descriptions from Seabrook: "plodding like brutes, like automatons," faces that are "expressionless" and "vacant," eyes "like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing."

14:  Interestingly, the identification of Haiti with zombies coincides with the de-identification of Haiti with cannibalism; Haiti becomes a land of eternal slaves rather than a land of cannibals. "Moreover, the zombie was transplanted into the United States almost exactly as the Great Depression began. For the first time since the Civil War and emancipation, much of the United States felt dispossessed. Many Americans were made aware of just how powerless they were in the capitalist system. Identification with zombies, then, may have been particularly resonant in the 1930s United States, as zombies became an ideological critique of modernity in the form of capitalist exploitation."

14-5:  Before "White Zombie," there was a play produced in New York simply titled "Zombie" that seemed to be a dramatization of Seabrook's book. *New York Times* theatre critic J. Brooks Atkinson reviewed, "If zombies are those who work without knowing why and who see without understanding, one begins to look around among one's fellow countrymen with a new apprehension. Perhaps those native drums are sounding the national anthem."

15:  The play introduced a common trope in the Haitian zombie: "a white woman is being threatened by a black figure with arms outstretched. The zombie threat to the whhite woman became an almost universal theme in early zombie fiction, and even as zombies moved out of Haiti, the image of the white woman endangered by a zombie would remain."

15:  "these films managed to use zombification of the white woman to speak to fears of miscegenation." But, fortunately, "The white male could defeat black 'corruption'; the white female could be saved."

15:  With advertisements for "White Zombie," "it is the zombie master's (sexual) desire that puts the woman in peril, and she is powerless against it."

16:  Hence, the zombie of the 1930s became associated with white slavery.

16:  Implications of moving zombie out of Haiti and associated with zombifying white women. "it implied that a primitive nature lurked inside the civilized white person: the zombie inhabited a space in which the white person feared there was no difference between him and the Other, that he was really dark, or primitive, at heart. As previously mentioned, it also spoke to fears of miscegenation. In an era when interracial coupling was still largely prohibited, or at least strongly frowned upon, there was a sense that zombification could represent the intermingling of 'black' magic and white bodies. Finally, it implicated the female: primitivism might be associated with one's gender. To borrow from Freud, women might really be 'the dark continent.'"

17:  "While zombiism seemed to strip those afflicted of their humanity, white males, in being able to overcome zombification, retained their humanity, or at least regained it--and this is key." Thus, the white male=human while the zombie=inhuman and the threatening connection between these two poles are white women who are susceptible to zombification.

17:  Quoting David Skal: "The shuffling spectacle of the walking dead in films like *White Zombie* (1932) was in many ways a nightmare vision of a breadline.... Millions already knew they were no longer completely in control of their lives; the economic strings were being pulled by faceless, frightening forces."

18:  "the 1935 film *Ouanaga* follows a Haitian Voodoo priestess in her attempts to win the love of a white man. The priestess is a mulatto, and with a tag line that claims, "Her skin is white but her heart is black," the film speaks to fears implicitly addressed in *White Zombie* related to miscegenation and the possibility of the primitive lurking within."

18:  "The Halperin brothers, producers of *White Zombie*, returned to the genre in 1936 with *Revolt of the Zombies*. The plot of the film centers on eliminating a zombie spell so it won't fall into the wrong (nonwhite) hands. Things are fine as long as zombiism only affects the natives, but it is clearly not acceptable when the zombie master begins to zombify the white members of an archaeological expedition."

20:  "zombies were under the control of a physically locatable outside force. In the early films, this control came via a Voodoo priest or sorcerer. During the 1950s, when fears connected to burgeoning space exploration became more prevalent, zombie control was also via mad scientists or aliens. Still, zombies never acted of their own accord: there was always some sort of zombie master pulling the strings."

20:  "What zombie conventions there were could be considered more like guidelines than fixed rules. Therefore, there was room to play."

21:  "The established ability to play with the rules of the zombie genre may have contributed to the radical break with the Voodoo-style zombie enacted by *Night of the Living Dead*, as with it, zombies moved from being automatons used as slave labor to being mindless killers. Now, rather than following the will of a specific master, zombies were following the drive to eat. They were now explicitly cannibals."

22:  "if an average, ordinary American could become a zombie, just like Haitians did, what really differentiated 'us' from 'them' anyway? Further, the zombie did the same kind of ideological work as the cannibal--it was a new means of separating the world into its civilized and barbaric categories."
